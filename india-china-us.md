I recently finished reading Dan Wang’s book "Breakneck". Its a great read and the book proposes a new way to think about modern states rather than trying to box them into traditional labels. 

Socialist. Communist. Capitalist. Neoliberal.
These categories describe ideology, but they do a poor job of explaining how societies actually behave. 

Instead, the book poses a more practical question: 
"Which professions in a society are given the intellectual latitude to think freely, operate with real autonomy, and have those people concentrated into positions of power?"

Once you start looking at countries through that framing, a lot becomes easier to explain. 
Which problems get attention. Which solutions feel legitimate. Which failures are tolerated. 

I pulled together [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1130Jt9ir5snwxtLGmaMxfPyuD8dAkdyDnzg6RG6hFQs/edit?usp=sharing) on the educational and professional backgrounds of people in power in the United States, China, and India to see what that framing revealed.  
As someone who was born in India, has lived in the United States, and now lives among a large Chinese diaspora in Canada, what strikes me most is how similar people across all three countries often are. There is a shared restlessness. A comfort with moving fast and accepting shortcuts, in exchange for momentum. 
More than that, there is a persistent orientation toward the future, a belief that tomorrow can be materially better than today, in a way that feels less pronounced in parts of Europe or Japan. 

Chinese and Americans are more similar in temperament and ambition than either side will admit - but yet all 3 countries have a very different styles of deploying their problem solving capability. Some of that can be explained through the new framing. 

In the United States, the profession with real intellectual latitude is law. Even in 2026, most senior officials are lawyers, trained through liberal arts pipelines and elite universities, with a thin layer of MBAs added for private sector dealmaking rather than technical depth. Hard science and engineering remain rare at the top, even in agencies responsible for energy, health, and infrastructure. The result is a governing class trained to manage process, interpret rules, and reduce risk.
This lawyerly orientation has real strengths. The American state is exceptionally good at slowing things down -both good and bad ideas. Ideas are forced through reviews, public comment, permitting, and litigation. That friction produces predictability, and predictability supports long term economic growth and capital formation.
The cost is visible. Very little gets built. When projects do move forward, they are often years behind schedule and wildly over budget. 

This is not a failure of competence. It is a system designed to avoid irreversible mistakes and diffuse accountability.This also explains where the United States still moves quickly. Software ships fast because it does not require zoning approval. Financial products proliferate because they live inside legal abstractions lawyers understand deeply. Code and capital move freely. Concrete and steel do not.
 
China represents the opposite model. It is an engineering society in both instinct and credential. For more than three decades, every Chinese president has held an engineering degree. The upper tiers of the state are dense with technocrats trained in aerospace, nuclear, and heavy industry. Tsinghua University serves as the primary pipeline into this leadership class, producing officials trained to think in terms of physical systems, throughput, and scale.
The outcomes are hard to miss. Thousands of miles of high speed rail. Vast highway networks. Ports like Shanghai that move more cargo than all U.S. ports combined. Entire cities built ahead of demand. These are not isolated achievements. They are the natural outcome of a state that believes production is a virtue and that most problems can be solved through design.

That instinct cuts both ways. Engineers are often willing to accept radical disruption in pursuit of an optimized system. The one child policy was an engineered solution to population growth. Zero COVID was an engineered solution to viral containment. Both were executed decisively, and both produced severe second order consequences. Engineering led systems tend to prioritize system performance over social elasticity.

India sits between these two models. Its permanent bureaucracy is overwhelmingly engineering-trained, while its political leadership remains largely generalist. Institutions like the IITs and NITs serve as key pipelines into the civil services, creating a technically grounded administrative core beneath ministers educated in law or the liberal arts.
At its best, this foundation has enabled some of the most effective digital public goods in the world. Aadhaar, UPI, and the India Stack operate at massive national scale and reflect an engineering mindset applied to governance. 

At the same time, India remains deeply entangled in procedural complexity inherited from its colonial administrative system. The result is a state capable of sweeping engineering interventions like demonetization, alongside labor and business regulations that are often opaque, inconsistent, and difficult to navigate. 
In practice, engineers frequently work around these procedures rather than reforming them outright. Getting things done in India often means navigating the system sideways, not straight through it. 

Each society trains different groups to think freely and gives different incentives to act. Over time, those choices shape how problems are framed and which solutions feel natural. The result is countries that engage with the world in fundamentally different ways, even when the people inside them are remarkably alike.
