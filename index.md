I am an **engineering leader**, **software developer** and **data product manager** with a knack for working on early stage products.  
I split my time between _Los Angeles_ and _Toronto_.

## Work
I'm an **Engineering Leader** at **Homebase** in service of the best damn data team in the world.   

I wear many hats. I lead a team of senior engineers to build solutions for
 * Machine learning automation
 * Big-data processing engines
 * Backend services for personalization
 * machine learned algorithms and rules-based engines.
 * Real-time stream processing

I've launched new services, optimized mature products, developed internal tools to support growth, marketing and sales teams. I specialize in bootstrapping and scaling a data practice and love working on early stage products. 


Before **Homebase**, I spent 4 years building amazing data products at **Thrive Market**

As the first big-data engineer at Thrive Market, I helped design and build data-processing and reporting tools.

I also acted as the **product manager** for **Search** and **User Personalization** experiences
on Thrive Market's website and mobile apps.



## Interests
I enjoy hiking, coding, craft brew and curating my Spotify playlist in my spare time.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
