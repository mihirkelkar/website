I am a **software developer** and a **data product manager** with a knack for working on early stage products.  
I split my time between _Los Angeles_ and _Toronto_.

## Work
I'm an **Engineering Leader** at **Thrive Market**.  
I wear many hats. I lead a team of senior engineers to build solutions for
 * Machine learning automation
 * Big-data processing engines
 * Backend services for user personalization
 * Product search and filtering algorithms
 * Real-time stream processing

 I am also the **product manager** for Thrive Market's _Search_ and _User Personalization_ experiences.

Previously, as the first data engineer at Thrive Market, I helped design and build data-processing and reporting tools.

I've launched new services, optimized mature products, developed internal tools for analytics and data access to support Thrive Market's growing marketing and merchandizing team. I helped hire and mentor over 20 contributors in the data organization at Thrive Market.

## Interests
I enjoy hiking, coding, craft brew and curating my Spotify playlist in my spare time.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
